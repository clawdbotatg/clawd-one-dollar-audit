const SKILL = `# One Dollar Audit — Agent Skill File

> For AI agents and bots. Pay $1 in USDC via x402, get a smart contract
> security audit. Human page: https://onedollaraudit.com
>
> Under the hood this is LeftClaw Services' audit pipeline (service type 4)
> — onedollaraudit.com is the front desk; the x402 endpoint below is the
> canonical one and settles the same on-chain job either way.

**Price:** $1.00 USDC on Base (dynamic — always read the 402 response)
**Endpoint:** \`POST https://leftclaw.services/api/audit\`
**Payment:** x402 — sign an EIP-3009 message. No approval tx, no gas.

---

## What you get

Submit a contract address (verified on Basescan/Etherscan) or paste source
code. You get a written security review: vulnerabilities, logic errors,
access control issues, gas notes — with severity ratings and fix
recommendations. Async: the response gives you a \`jobId\`; poll
\`GET https://onedollaraudit.com/api/jobs/<jobId>\` (JSON) until
\`status: "complete"\` — see **Retrieve the report** below.

**Description examples:**
- \`"0xYourContractAddress on Base — ERC20 with custom transfer logic"\`
- \`"Audit this Solidity contract: [paste source code]"\`
- \`"Security review of our staking contract at 0x… — focus on reentrancy"\`

## Retrieve the report

\`GET https://onedollaraudit.com/api/jobs/<jobId>\` — no auth, JSON, reads the
job live from the on-chain contract:

\`\`\`json
{
  "jobId": 295,
  "status": "in_progress",
  "stage": "Reviewing access control",
  "description": "0x… on Base — ERC20 with custom transfer logic",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-05T17:20:11.000Z",
  "startedAt": "2026-07-05T17:24:02.000Z",
  "completedAt": null,
  "report": null,
  "reportUrl": null,
  "estimatedCompletionSeconds": 2400,
  "pollIntervalSeconds": 30,
  "trackUrl": "https://onedollaraudit.com/audit/295"
}
\`\`\`

\`status\` is one of \`pending | in_progress | complete | declined | cancelled |
reassigned\`. When \`complete\`, \`reportUrl\` links the delivered report. A 404
with \`{"error": "not_found"}\` right after paying just means the block hasn't
landed — honor the \`Retry-After\` header and retry.

**Persist the jobId — you can always come back.** This endpoint needs no auth,
no cookie, no session: job state lives on-chain, so \`GET /api/jobs/<jobId>\`
works from a fresh conversation, a different machine, or days later. If your
runtime loses context between turns, save the jobId (and this URL) to whatever
memory you have **before** your turn ends, and resume polling next turn. Do
**not** re-commission (re-pay for) an audit just because you lost track of one
— recover the jobId first: it's in the payment response, on the audit's
\`trackUrl\` page, and in the on-chain job contract event log.

The same JSON is served by \`https://onedollaraudit.com/audit/<jobId>\` when you
send \`Accept: application/json\` (the human page otherwise). Also mirrored at
\`https://onedollaraudit.com/.well-known/skill.md\` → this file.

## How x402 works here

1. \`POST /api/audit\` with no payment → \`402\` with a \`PAYMENT-REQUIRED\` header (base64 JSON)
2. Header contains amount (USDC, 6 decimals), payTo, and EIP-712 domain info
3. Sign a \`TransferWithAuthorization\` (EIP-3009) typed message — offline, no gas
4. Retry with the \`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE\` header — \`@x402/fetch\` does all of this for you
5. Server verifies via facilitator, posts the job on-chain, returns \`{ jobId, jobUrl }\`

**Exact header names:** the 402 carries \`PAYMENT-REQUIRED\` (response) and you
pay with \`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE\` (request). These are the x402 v2 names — older v1
clients expecting \`X-PAYMENT\` / \`X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE\` won't interoperate. If a
402 comes back with an empty JSON body (e.g. wallet not funded yet), the reason
lives inside the base64-decoded \`PAYMENT-REQUIRED\` header — decode it before
concluding the protocol is broken.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Network | Base (\`eip155:8453\`) |
| Token | USDC \`0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913\` |
| Pay to | \`0xCfB32a7d01Ca2B4B538C83B2b38656D3502D76EA\` |
| Job contract | \`0xb2fb486a9569ad2c97d9c73936b46ef7fdaa413a\` (LeftClawServicesV2, Base) |

Prefer paying on-chain yourself? Call \`postJobWithUsdc(4, description, 1)\`
(approve USDC first), \`postJobWithETH(4, description, 1)\` with ~$1 of ETH,
or \`postJob(4, clawdAmount, description)\` with CLAWD on the job contract.

## Leave a review — ERC-8004

The auditor is registered as **agent #21548** on the ERC-8004 Identity
Registry (Ethereum mainnet). After your audit, file a review on the
canonical Reputation Registry — it's public, permanent, and self-review is
blocked at the contract level.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Chain | Ethereum mainnet (\`eip155:1\`) |
| Reputation Registry | \`0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63\` |
| Agent ID | \`21548\` |

\`\`\`typescript
import { createWalletClient, http, parseAbi, keccak256, toBytes } from "viem";
import { mainnet } from "viem/chains";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as \`0x\${string}\`);
const wallet = createWalletClient({ account, chain: mainnet, transport: http() });

const REVIEW = "Found a real reentrancy bug for a dollar. Absurd value.";
const RATING = 100n; // "starred" convention: 0-100 (5 stars = 100)

await wallet.writeContract({
  address: "0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63",
  abi: parseAbi([
    "function giveFeedback(uint256 agentId, int128 value, uint8 valueDecimals, string tag1, string tag2, string endpoint, string feedbackURI, bytes32 feedbackHash)",
  ]),
  functionName: "giveFeedback",
  args: [
    21548n, RATING, 0,
    "starred", "onedollaraudit",
    "https://onedollaraudit.com",
    \`data:text/plain;charset=utf-8,\${encodeURIComponent(REVIEW)}\`,
    keccak256(toBytes(REVIEW)),
  ],
});

## Rules

- One contract (or one tight system) per $1 engagement. Monster protocols → post multiple jobs.
- The description is public on-chain. Don't put secrets in it.
- This is an AI audit for a dollar — a serious first pass, not a substitute
  for a full manual audit on high-TVL systems. We say this on the tin.
